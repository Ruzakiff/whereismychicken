            <div class="faq-question">What does "Estimated Ready Time" mean?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                The Estimated Ready Time is our best guess for when the next batch of rotisserie chickens will be ready. We use a combination of the standard schedule and real-time adjustments, so this time may vary slightly from the schedule. Think of it as a close estimate, but not an exact time.

            <div class="faq-question">Why is there a difference between the Scheduled Time and the Estimated Ready Time?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                Scheduled times are based on the Club's typical cooking schedule, while the Estimated Ready Time accounts for slight delays or faster preparation due to factors like worker availability. Our goal is to give you a realistic idea of when chickens will be ready, even if it doesn't match the exact schedule.

            <div class="faq-question">How accurate is the Estimated Ready Time?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                The Estimated Ready Time is usually accurate within +/- 30 minutes. While we do our best to keep it reliable, unexpected delays can happen. We recommend checking back occasionally if you're planning to pick up a chicken soon.

            <div class="faq-question">Can I rely on this time to avoid waiting?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                We hope this tool saves you time, but since it's only an estimate, we can't guarantee it will always be perfectly accurate. Use it as a helpful guide, and check for updates to make sure the timing is still close.
