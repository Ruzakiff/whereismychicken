STORE 4722--so people know its just for this store??


This simplified version:
1. Focuses on the main question: "How Long for Chicken?"
2. Displays a large, easy-to-read time for when the next batch of chicken will be ready.
3. Includes a button to access more detailed information about specific ovens if needed.
Key points:
The main screen is extremely simple and answers the primary question at a glance.
The "See Oven Details" button allows access to more specific information without cluttering the main view.
The design is clean and readable, suitable for quick glances in a busy kitchen environment.
To implement this:
1. The main time displayed would be the shortest time among all ovens.
2. You'd need JavaScript to periodically update this time, fetching data from your backend.
3. The "See Oven Details" button could open a modal or navigate to another page showing the status of each oven, including predicted finish times and leftovers.
4. You could add simple color coding (e.g., green when time > 30 min, yellow for 10-30 min, red for < 10 min) to give a quick visual cue of urgency.
This approach maintains simplicity for ease of use while still allowing access to more detailed information when needed. It's suitable for all users, including older staff members, while still providing the option for more in-depth data for those who need it.



Proposed Solution:
1. Implement the "Actual Chicken Time" button in the UI.
2. When pressed, record:
The predicted time for this batch
The actual time input by the user
The current date and time
3. Implement a combination of immediate adjustment and offset tracking:
adjusted_prediction
4. Periodically (e.g., nightly), analyze the collected data:
If the average offset is consistently large, consider retraining the model.
If there are patterns in the offsets (e.g., always off by more on weekends), consider adding features to the model or creating separate models for different scenarios.
5. Long-term improvement:
Implement a more sophisticated online learning algorithm that can adjust the model parameters in real-time based on feedback.
Consider using a time series forecasting model that can capture trends and seasonality, such as ARIMA or Prophet.
6. Meta-learning:
Keep track of how often the button is pressed. If it's pressed very frequently, it might indicate that the predictions are consistently off and the system needs improvement.
If it's rarely pressed, it might mean the predictions are good, or users aren't engaging with this feature.
By implementing these steps, you create a system that can:
Quickly adapt to short-term changes
Gradually improve over time
Provide data for more significant model improvements
Engage users in improving the system
This approach balances immediate responsiveness with long-term stability and improvement, addressing the core issue of prediction drift while providing multiple avenues for refinement.
